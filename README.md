# titanic_dataset_insight_by_syeda
Project Objective
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to extract meaningful patterns, clean the data, and visualize key insights — especially those related to passenger survival.
Tools & Libraries Used
-Python

Pandas – for data manipulation and cleaning

Seaborn / Matplotlib – for visualizations and plots

Task Description
The task includes the following steps:

Load the Titanic dataset

Import and inspect the dataset to understand its structure and variables.

Clean the data

Handle missing values (fill Age and Embarked, drop Cabin)

Convert data types (make Sex, Embarked, Pclass categorical)

Generate summary statistics

Use group-based insights ( survival rate by gender, class, and port)

Visualize key patterns

Create countplots, histograms, and heatmaps to explore relationships

Example: visualizing how survival rates differ by gender and class

Bonus Visualization

Use bar plots and heatmaps to provide a deeper visual understanding of survival trends

-Insights Gained
Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

1st class passengers had better survival chances compared to 2nd and 3rd class.

Port of embarkation and age also influenced survival rates.
